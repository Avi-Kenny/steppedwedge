# steppedwedge: Analyze Data from Stepped Wedge Cluster Randomized Trials

Provide various functions and tools to help fit models for estimating
treatment effects in stepped wedge cluster randomized trials. Implements
methods described in Kenny, Voldal, Xia, and Heagerty (2022) "Analysis
of stepped wedge cluster randomized trials in the presence of a
time-varying treatment effect",
[doi:10.1002/sim.9511](https://doi.org/10.1002/sim.9511) .
