\title{Set advanced parameters for analysis of data from stepped wedge trials}
\usage{
advanced_params(offset = NULL, n_knots_exp = 4, n_knots_cal = 4)
}
\arguments{
\item{offset}{A linear predictor offset term; see docs for `lme4::lmer`.}

\item{n_knots_exp}{An integer; only relevant when exp_time="NCS". Specifies
the number of knots to use for exposure time, including boundary knots.
The spline basis includes an intercept, and the degree of the basis is
equal to the number of knots.}

\item{n_knots_cal}{An integer; only relevant when cal_time="NCS". Specifies
the number of knots to use for calendar time, including boundary knots.
The spline basis includes an intercept, and the degree of the basis is
equal to the number of knots.}
}
\value{
A list of options
}
\description{
This should be used in conjunction with \code{\link{analyze}} to
    set parameters controlling analysis; see examples.
